### Introduction

Bioware's Infinity Engine was used from 1998 to 2002 to power 2D isometric RPGs such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and their sequels and expansions. Starting in 2012, remakes of these games have been developed, and the Infinity Engine remains popular today.

This project is mostly a proof of concept learning experience and is currently unfinished.
