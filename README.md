# infinity.d
**Infinity Engine file processor written in D**

### Introduction

Bioware's Infinity Engine was used from 1998 to 2002 to power 2D isometric RPGs such as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and their sequels and expansions. Starting in 2012, remakes of these games have been developed, and the Infinity Engine remains popular today.

This project was started as [infinity.lua](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/infinity.lua), which evolved to use LuaJIT's C FFI for performance and regular Lua for readability and rapid prototyping. Since this combination is one of the D's selling points, I decided to make the switch. I am mostly continuing this project to learn D, though it may later evolve into something more practical.
